It is possible to enter two WIFI networks:

wifiSsid=x			set primary AP ssid
wifiPassword=x			set primary AP password
wifiSsid2=x			set backup AP ssid (replace primary wifi automatically in 1-2 minutes)
wifiPassword2=x			set backup AP password

If only one wifi network is entered, evDash starts and connects to it. Ready!

If two networks are entered, an attempt is made to connect to the first on startup.

Then it waits 4 seconds and checks whether there is a connection.
If not, it does a failover and tries to connect to the second.
Every time data is sent, it is checked whether a connection exists.
If not, evDash switches between the two Wifi networks.

If you want to delete the second Wifi again, because you only want to use one, or you want to get rid of the 4 sec. delay, you have to enter:

wifiSsid2=empty

Don't forget to save:

saveSettings
reboot
